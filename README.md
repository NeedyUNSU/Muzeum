## üß† Data Model

Each exhibit is represented as a `struct lib`:

```c
struct lib {
 ulint id;
 uchar title[255];
 uchar descr[255];
 slint yearofexistence;
 bool century;
 float weight;
 usint day, month, year;
 uchar state;
 usint room;
 lib* nextval;
};
````

| Field                  | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                   | Unique session-generated exhibit ID                      |
| `title`                | Exhibit title                                            |
| `descr`                | Exhibit description                                      |
| `yearofexistence`      | Year (or century if enabled) the exhibit originates from |
| `century`              | Flag: interpret `yearofexistence` as a century           |
| `weight`               | Exhibit weight in kilograms                              |
| `day`, `month`, `year` | Date added to the database                               |
| `state`                | Physical condition: `A` (new) ‚Üí `E` (destroyed)          |
| `room`                 | Room number where the exhibit is located (0 = storage)   |
